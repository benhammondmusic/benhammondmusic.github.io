# Tanks!

## Concept:

_"What goes up must come down..."_
**Blood, Sweat & Tears**

Players take turns lobbing projectiles; anyone sustaining a hit is destroyed. Last one standing wins!

## Tech:

    - HTML
    - CSS / BOOTSTRAP
    - JavaScript / jQuery
    - HTML Canvas

## Approach:

As a kid Tank Wars was an early favorite, and the simple yet compelling game play seemed perfect for my first JS project. Some initial googling of simple games introduced me to HTML Canvas as a well supported, well documented way to animate shapes in the browser. It was important for me to get started quickly with a simple version, while also having the ability to make the game more complex and detailed if time allowed.

## Challenges:

One of the first challenges was simply learning HTML Canvas itself; some ideas that may be standard in animation seemed quirky (e.g. rotating the canvas, drawing a straight line, and rotating back to accomplish an angled line). I got a lot of initial ideas from studying simple JS clock animations.

A second challenge came in implementing the actual physics and math to calculate a projectile's path. While fairly straightforward and well documented in high-school course websites, it took some work translating the physics (gravitational vertical acceleration) and trigonometry (SIN, COSIN) speak into my computer code.

## Known Bugs and Wonkiness Being Fixed:

- Terrain generation and drawing needs to be scoped out of game.newGame() to make **Change Terrain** button operational, and to allow **New Game** button to start play on existing terrain.
- Display explosion AFTER shot lands
- Make tanks fall when ground under them is destroyed. Maybe can hurt them if hit points are implemented?
- Flatten terrain directly below tanks.

## Cool Features In Progress:

- Animations (explosions, tank destruction)

## Future Ideas:

- Make mobile responsive and playable with on-screen controls to fire keyboard inputs
- Add chem trails to see last shot. Slow fade out?
- Make craters more jagged, more visually interesting.
- Add computer logic for **Robot** players.
- Utilize actual images
- Use BÃ©zier curves for terrain instead of straight lines.
- Use slider(s) under **Change Players** button
- Place titles, graphics, etc on top of canvas
- Randomize starting player. Weight towards those in the middle since they are most in danger?
- Spread tanks further apart, rather than evenly spaced.
- Improve shot detection to account for tank size, explosion size **as circles**
- Allow shots off screen horizontally to wrap back from other side?
- Allow shots that hit bottom of screen (where ground has been destroyed to bounce)
- Integrate terrain steepness? Increase as gameplay continues in multiple rounds?
- Keep running tally of player wins; allow names for players. Allow custom tank objects.
- Add snow capped mountains
- Add Trees
- Build your own level: click on screen to add terrain nodes. Place your own tanks like in Settlers of Catan.
- Add Day/Night displays, with limited visibility.
- Add wind to buffet shots around horizontally. Trees could indicate wind-direction and velocity.
- Add mouse functionality for game-play.
