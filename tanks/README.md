# Tank Battle

## Concept:

Players take turns lobbing projectiles at one another. First one to get a direct hit wins!

## Technologies Used:

    - HTML
    - CSS / BOOTSTRAP
    - JavaScript / jQuery
    - HTML Canvas

## Approach:

As a kid, Tank Wars was an early favorite, and the simple yet compelling game play seemed perfect for my first real JS project. Some initial googling of simple games introduced me to HTML Canvas as a well supported, well documented way to animate shapes in the browser. It was important to get started quickly with a simple version, while also having the ability to make the game more complex and detailed if time allowed.

## Challenges:

One of the first challenges was simply learning HTML Canvas itself; some things that may be standard in animation but which seemed quirky at first (e.g. rotating the canvas, drawing a straight line, and rotating back to accomplish an angled line). I got a lot of ideas from studying simple JS clock animations.

A second challenge came in the actual physics and math involved in calculating a projectile's path. Fairly straightforward and well documented in high-school course websites, it took some effort translating the physics (gravitational vertical acceleration) and trigonometry (SIN, COSIN) speak into computer code.
