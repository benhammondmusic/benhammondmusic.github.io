# Tanks!

## Concept:

_"What goes up must come down..."_
**Blood, Sweat & Tears**

Players take turns lobbing projectiles; anyone sustaining a hit is destroyed. Last one standing wins!

## Tech:

    - HTML
    - CSS / BOOTSTRAP
    - JavaScript / jQuery
    - HTML Canvas

## Approach:

As a kid Tank Wars was an early favorite, and the simple yet compelling game play seemed perfect for my first JS project. Some initial googling of simple games introduced me to HTML Canvas as a well supported, well documented way to animate shapes in the browser. It was important for me to get started quickly with a simple version, while also having the ability to make the game more complex and detailed if time allowed.

## Challenges:

One of the first challenges was simply learning HTML Canvas itself; some ideas that may be standard in animation seemed quirky (e.g. rotating the canvas, drawing a straight line, and rotating back to accomplish an angled line). I got a lot of inital ideas from studying simple JS clock animations.

A second challenge came in implementing the actual physics and math to calculate a projectile's path. While fairly straightforward and well documented in high-school course websites, it took some work translating the physics (gravitational vertical acceleration) and trigonometry (SIN, COSIN) speak into my computer code.
